# golang-webapp-setup

This is just a test golang webapp project derived from [golang docs](https://golangdocs.com/golang-web-application) with a few modifications to run the latest go redis and make use of modules.

No tests included as it was just a little follow along.

`go run webApp.go` to run it on mac os.
